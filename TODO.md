# TODO List

### May 23rd - Thursday

- [x] Change `onInput` for search to a `button` and `v-on:keyup.enter`

- [x] Make `Video List Items` have a transition.

- [ ] Give `Video List Items` pagination.

- [ ] When a user clicks on a `Video List Item`, scroll to the video.

- [ ] When user searches, scroll to list.

- [ ] Make search `position: fixed` on mobile

- [ ] Change welcome text to something more appealing.

- [ ] Make colors gradients instead of flat colors. Maybe add drop-shadows too.

- [ ] Add search history.

- [ ] Move away from Bootstrap grid, and move to CSS grid. This way I can do stuff like let the search results get as long as they need to be, while the search history stays under the video result.

- [ ] Add scss global variables file.
